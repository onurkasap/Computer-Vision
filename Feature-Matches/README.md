Feature Matching with OpenCV

This project demonstrates different feature matching techniques in computer vision using OpenCV and Python.
The goal is to detect keypoints between two images (img1.jpg and img2.jpg) and match them using different algorithms.

📂 Files

matching.py → Contains the implementations for feature detection and matching.

img1.jpg → Query image.

img2.jpg → Training image.

🔑 Implemented Methods
1. SIFT + Brute-Force (with Ratio Test)

Uses the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) detector.

Matches descriptors with a Brute-Force matcher.

Applies Lowe’s ratio test to filter out poor matches.

2. ORB + Brute-Force (Hamming Distance)

Uses the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) detector.

Descriptors are matched with Hamming distance.

Displays the top-N matches sorted by distance.

3. SIFT + FLANN (KD-Tree Search + Ratio Test)

Uses FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) for efficient matching.

Applies KD-Tree for indexing and nearest-neighbor search.

Employs Lowe’s ratio test to remove incorrect matches.

📊 Visualization

Each method visualizes the matches between the two images using matplotlib.
Examples include lines drawn between matched keypoints.

🚀 Requirements

Python 3.8+

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib

Install the dependencies with:

pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

▶️ Usage

Run the script to test feature matching:

python matching.py

📸 Example Output

The program will display side-by-side images with keypoints and connecting lines showing the matches.
